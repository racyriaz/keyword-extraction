- The Podcast dataset used in this program is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/listennotes/all-podcast-episodes-published-in-december-2017)

- Also I would thank to Spotify Developers website for creating a very good documentation for Spotify Web API, Spotipy (Python module for Spotify web servers) for making the requesting process more flexible, and I want to especially thank to Kaggle Community for allowing me the opportunity to share this project!
